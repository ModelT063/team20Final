## User Story 326 - As a developer, I need to research MaterialUI, so that I can use their components for our interface

#### Task 512 - Read through MaterialUI docs on their website
* I used MUI extensively in the internship I'm at so I am familiar with how to use and integrate MUI components and icons into our app. The bulk of the documentation we'd be using is found here
* https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/

#### Task 513 - Watch a Youtube video explaining how to incorporate MaterialUI icons
* I used MUI extensively in the internship I'm at so I am familiar with how to use and integrate MUI components and icons into our app. The bulk of the documentation we'd be using is found here

## User Story 320 - As a developer, I need to set up our Github repository, so that we can develop our project
#### Task 480 - Make sure I can clone in and make changes to the repository
* I was able to successfully clone, and push/pull changes to a repository on my local machine
* I've used git on a regular basis for the past few years so I am already familiar with basic git operations

## User Story 322 - As a developer, I need to research Github pull requests, so I can make changes to our project code
#### Task 474 - Look up example of a Pull Request
* I've used git on a regular basis for school, personal, and professional applications so I've opened and merged a lot of pull requests
* Specifically on the school side, I merged most if not all of my groups PRs for the main project for CPSC 3720 - Software Engineering

## User Story 91 - As a developer, I will need to write code to connect to the database, so that I can store application data
#### Task 489 - Create the database on AWS
* I not only went through the lab exercise for creating the database, but I went through the process of creating our group's database on AWS including editing the security group and VPC so that we can connect outside applications to our database
#### Task 523 - Look over an example of connecting to an AWS database
* After I created the database on AWS, I successfully connected MySQL Workbench to it using the master user so that we can execute SQL on our database without having to write extra code if we need to. 

## User Story 327 - As a developer, I need to research JSX, so that I can write HTML inside my JavaScript code 
#### Task 514 - Review the JSX doc on the ReactJS website
* I've also used React JSX (specifically TSX) at my internship so I am familiar with how to use JSX components within an application
* One thing I learned from reviewing the documentation found below, is that JSX inherently helps to prevent XSS attacks by converting any input to strings before rendering
* https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html


## User Story 351 - As a developer, I need to research the Express framework, so that I can write backend code in JavaScript
#### Task 516 - Review the Express docs online
* After reviewing some of the docs, it seems like Express is more of a server side API framework and it has some routing options that looked very similar to what we'd be using Nextjs for so I also did a little research on what the difference is between them as well as if they're compatable/should you use both

* SO Do I have to use Express with Next?: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58742343/do-i-have-to-use-express-in-next-js-project

#### Task 518 - Watch a video on how to create an API in Express
* I watched this video on creating an API in Express

## User Story 208 - As a developer I need to research Amazon Cognito to potentially use as a account management service within our application
#### Task 492 - Read documentation on getting started with Cognito
* Since we'd be using Cognito to do user sign ins, we'd need to work with "User Pools"
* What is Cognito: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html
* Get started with User Pools: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-cognito-user-pools.html 

#### Task 495 - Setup a basic connection with Cognito 
* After learning a little bit about Cognito, this task really doesn't make all that much sense
* This week we can hopefully come together as a group and decide on exactly what attributes our user will have, what our username/password requirements are, what emails we're going to send out, etc. all the info that Cognito needs to set up a user pool
* Instead of acutally setting up a connection, I reviewed how to actually integrate cognito with an application
* Integrating Cognito into an App: https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/js/
