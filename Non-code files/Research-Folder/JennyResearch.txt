Next.js Tutorial:

About next.js:
- next.js = flexible react framework giving building blocks for web apps
- building blocks of a web app:
	- user interface, routing, data fetching, rendering, integrations, infrastructure, performance, scalability, developer experience
- react = javascript library for building interactive user interfaces
- next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React
- build UI with react, then add next.js features to solve common application requirements, like routing, data fetching, and integrations

From JavaScript to react:
- document object model (DOM) - object representation of the HTML elements
	- acts as a bridge between code and user interface; tree-like structure
- DOM allows targeted manipulation

Three core React concepts:
1) components
	- building blocks of the UI
	- in react, components show up as functions
2) props
	- pieces of information passed as properties to react components (custom arguments)
3) state
	- any information that changes over time, usually triggered by user interaction
	- managed by react hooks
